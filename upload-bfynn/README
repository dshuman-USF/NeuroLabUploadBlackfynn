This is a table driven program that uses a .csv file to map your file system's
organization and naming conventions to the MAP-Core file system and naming
conventions. The .csv file format is documented in:

     TEMPLATE-for-SPARC-list-of-files-to-upload.xlsx

It creates the required directory hierearchy as specified by:
https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1EQPn1FmANpPsFt3CguU-JOQVMMlJsNXluQAK_gb2qVg/edit#slide=id.p1

The dataset must already exist and you need to have an API key. That process is
documented here:

https://developer.blackfynn.io/python/latest/index.html

The program creates collections if required and uploads local files to the
Blackfynn site. Collections and datapackages are renamed according to the
standards.

This can be run from a command line window.
Most users should use upload_bfynn_win.pyw program.
This provies a GUI wrapper that uses this class and is a lot friendlier to use.
