The Big Idea here is that you create a spreadsheet that creates a template for
folders and names that meet the DAT-Core and MAP-Core standards.

Then you list the sources of the files that will be copied to these folders.

Then you run the Python program upload_bfynn.py and it will do the work for you.

Load the file "TEMPLATE-for-SPARC-list-of-files-to-upload.xlsx" into excel and read it.

Then read and follow the instructions in the "WindowsInstall.txt" file.

Then run the demo at step #4.

Then you can start creating your real spreadsheet using the demo spreadsheet as a model.
