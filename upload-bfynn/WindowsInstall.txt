                                November 21, 2019

1. If Python3 is not already, install Python3

Open a browser such as Edge, Chrome, or Firefox. In the  browser, browse to:

https://www.python.org/downloads/windows/

Pick "Latest Python 3 Release"

There may be versions that appear to be more recent than the Latest Release. At
the time of this writing, 3.8.0 is the latest stable release.

Scroll down and pick:
If you are running a 64-bit version of Windows:
__ Download "Windows x86-64 executable installer"
If you are running a 32-bit version of Windows:
__ Download "Windows x86 executable installer"
__ Run the downloaded file 
__ Check the box to "Add Python to PATH" (This is important and easy to miss.)
__ Click on "Install Now"
__ Wait for install to complete.

2. Install the Blackfynn Python module.

Browse to:

https://developer.blackfynn.io/python/latest/quickstart.html#installation

You need to open a command line window so you can type in some commands. Note
that this is a Windows command line window. It is not a window that has Python
running in it.

___ In Windows 7, type "cmd" in the start button search box. A list should pop
    up. You should see "cmd.exe" in the list. Right click on this and select
    "run as an admin".
    In Windows 10, right click on the Windows logo in the bottom left
    corner of the toolbar.  You will see Command Line(Admin) or Windows
    PowerShell(Admin). Click on this.

You will be asked if it is okay for this app to make changes to the system.
Click on Okay.  A window should open. 

In the command line window, type (as shown on the web page we browed to above)

pip3 install -U blackfynn

__ Wait for install to complete

Leave the command window open, we will need it later.

3. Install the Blackfynn agent

Open a browser such as Edge, Chrome, or Firefox and browse to:

https://developer.blackfynn.io/agent/index.html

__ Click on the download and install for Windows.
__ Run the downloaded file.
__ Accept the license. Accept the default suggestions.
__ Wait for install to complete.

There is a link on the left side of this page to a tutorial that tells you how
to configure the agent.

Click on "Tutorial 1 - The basics" and follow the instructions to create a key
and register a profile. Use the command window to enter the commands. You
should save your key and secret to a text file.

4. This zip file comes with a demo that you can run when you get to this step.
__ Edit the "C:\upload_blackfynn\working\win_upload_text.xlsx" file and put
your dataset name in cell A4. You may want to create a test dataset on the
blackfynn site to play around with this.
__ Save this, then select Save as and save it as a .csv file.
__ Follow the steps in the last item in item #6 below.

5. Create desktop shortcut
__ Right click in the desktop background and select New->shortcut. Browse to
where you installed the upload_blackfyn files. Select upload_blackfyn.pyw.
After the shortcut is added to the desktop, right click on it and select
Properties. Make sure the Starts in folder is the same as the upload_blackfyn
files.

6. Create the .csv file the upload program uses to upload files.
The details of how to do this are the file:

"TEMPLATE-for-SPARC-list-of-files-to-upload.xlsx"

7. Upload files to Blackfynn
Click on the shortcut. Use the upload Window to select the .csv file you want
to use and start the upload.

8. If you encounter errors or problems, you can copy the text in the upload
window to the clip board. Email this to:
