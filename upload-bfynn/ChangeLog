2020-01-13  dshuman@usf.edu

	* TEMPLATE-for-SPARC-list-of-files-to-upload.xlsx: updated documentation
	* configure.ac: bump to 1.0.17.
	* Makefile.am: Add zip file to distribution (for next release)

2019-11-05  dshuman@usf.edu

	* upload_bfynn.py: The names of top level folders has been changed. Look up
	list modified to conform.
	* upload_bfynn.py: Fix bug in ok_to_update that only shows up in debugger, 
	refered to a var that does not exist.

2019-08-05  dale@health.usf.edu

	* upload_bfynn.py: Added several manifest.??? names to the PROTECTED_NAMES
	list.
	* configure.ac: Bump to 1.0.16.

2019-07-12  dale@health.usf.edu

	* upload_bfynn.py: Decide that reading csv errors are fatal. No way to know
	what is wrong, best just to tell user and bail.
	* configure.ac: bump to 1.0.14
	* upload_bfynn.py: addin a check for collection ready before using it. My
	test program *STILL* sometimes fails to rename a file.
	Also add in the total path of the destination folder in printing the
	destination.
	* upload_bfynn_win.pyw: Correct dataset to datapack in help text.
	* upload_bfynn.py: elapsed wait time did not show correct minutes. Use
	existing function instead of my buggy code.
	* configure.ac: bump to 1.0.15 and do new release.

2019-07-11  dale@health.usf.edu

	* upload_bfynn_win.pyw: Fix some errors with utf-8 handling by telling user
	not to do that. Some refactoring to tighten up the code.

2019-07-09  dale@health.usf.edu

	* upload_bfynn_win.pyw: Some additions to help text, and how to boldface
	something in a line of text. 
	Text window now spans the width of the window.
	* Makefile.am: Use sed to update version string in python files. Silly to
	have to remember to do it manually.
	* configure.ac: Bump 10 1.0.12
	* upload_bfynn.py: the do not add extension flag was not being checked when
	using the agent. Fixed.
	* configure.ac: Bump to 1.0.13

2019-07-08  dale@health.usf.edu

	* upload_bfynn_win.pyw: Fix bug in grid spacing in window when only 1
	profile.
	* upload_bfynn_win.pyw: Bump to 1.0.11
	* upload_bfynn.py: Bump to 1.0.11
	* configure.ac: Bump to 1.0.11

2019-06-28  dale@health.usf.edu

	* configure.ac: bump to 1.0.10. The BF folk seem to think they have
	addressed some of the upload issues I was having, such as clobbering the
	state. They agreed this was a problem and made some mods. Now, need to mod
	my code to remove some hackage.

2019-03-14  dale@health.usf.edu

	* configure.ac: Bump to 1.0.9 and release. No significant functional
	changes.
	* upload_bfynn.py: Remove setting real name property set and get, the
	rename operation seems to always work (for now.)

2019-03-08  dale@health.usf.edu

	* upload_bfynn.py: Some diagnostics to catch rare late-night upload errors.
	Add in counter to keep track of files uploaded.

2019-03-07  dale@health.usf.edu

	* upload_bfynn.py: Not sure why, but at least found what seems to be a
	reliable way to know when it is safe to rename a data package. If we wait
	until the dpkg.sources attribute has a value, the rename seems to always
	work. 
	* upload_bfynn.py: If you upload two files with the same base name but with
	different file extensions AND if blackfynn removes the extensions, you
	cannot rename the second file to have the same name as the first one. To
	address this, the upload program checks to see if the extension has been
	removed and if so, adds _ext to the end of the datapackage name.  Files
	with no extension or are types blackfynn does not know only have the
	BIDS-SPARC prefix naming text added.
	* configure.ac: bump up to 1.0.8

2019-03-06  dale@health.usf.edu

	* upload_bfynn.py: name_conform: sometimes the rename fails to "take".
	Doing a dpkg.update() should resync with the bf server, but sometimes it
	does not. Some attempts to at least detect this. More work required for
	this.
	* upload_bfynn_win.pyw: addin Clear Text button.

2019-03-05  dale@health.usf.edu

	* upload_bfynn.py: get_profile_list():  Look at a different section of the
	Settings object for the real profile. On Windows, there is an agent profile
	that the bfAgent program adds (I guess.) It does not have credentials, so
	you cannot use it to log in to a dataset. We now check for an api_token
	before adding profile to the list.

2019-03-04  dale@health.usf.edu

	* upload_bfynn.py: name_conform: remove requirement file must have a
	prefix, files in the base directory may also need extension extending.

2019-03-01  dale@health.usf.edu

	* WindowsInstall.txt: Update to use pip3, not pip. This is a python3
	program.
	* upload_bfynn.py: modify name_conform to add the extension to end of fname
	so we can tell what the heck we are looking at. Also solves problem that
	you cannot rename file.csv and file.xlsx because without the extension,
	they have the same fname, which BF throws an exception to. Now, names
	guaranteed to be unique.
	* upload_bfynn.py: Fix bug in do_upload where new data type was not created
	under second level (subjects, samples, etc.) when not using sessions.

2019-02-28  dale@health.usf.edu

	* upload_bfynn.py: Add try except block around reading in .csv header in
	several functions.  Windows sometimes puts chars in the text that Linux
	does not seem to recognize. Since we don't care what is in the header, this
	should not be a fatal error (and it was.)
	* upload_bfynn.py: fix bug in collection_chk where hung in loop if a file
	and a collection had the same name when traversing a collection hierarchy.
	* configure.ac: bump to 1.0.5

2019-02-27  dale@health.usf.edu

	* upload_bfynn_win.pym: Create gui wrapper around upload_bfynn.py module.
	Release inital version.

2019-02-27  dale@health.usf.edu

	* upload_bfynn.py: break a couple of operations in Setup out to functions
	so upload_bfynn_win can use this without needing to know about blackfynn
	api.

2019-02-26  dale@health.usf.edu

	* upload_bfynn.py: addin hooks for the gui window that uses this.

2019-02-11  dale@health.usf.edu

	* upload_bfynn.py: Add in check to make sure dataset is ready before
	changing name. Is not clear we have to do this, but there was one instance
	where a file did not get renamed. Could not reproduce. Some sort of race
	condition between local and bf site states?
	* upload_bfynn.py: Version 1.0.3

2019-02-07  dale@health.usf.edu

	* Makefile.am: add in upload_bfynn.py to scripts line so it winds up on
	/usr/local/bin on local installs.
	* upload_bfynn.py: Major rewrite of how uploads are done. You can upload a
	set of files as a unit for files that are logically connected and need to
	wind up in the same dataset.  You can also use wildcards to specify
	potentially large lists of files.  These are uploaded and renamed one at
	time for better restartability.  Indicate files to be uploaded as a set
	using brackets, like so: [path/file1,path/file2].


2019-02-05  dshuman@health.usf.edu

	* upload_bfynn.py: Start ChangeLog. 
	Fix bugs:
	1. Blank path/fname or path/fname that was just spaces were not filtered
	out and program complained about not finding invisible filenames.
	2. Did not correctly step back out to the top level collection when a new
	subject line was encountered.
	3. Add in print version statement.
